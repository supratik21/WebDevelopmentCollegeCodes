                    <p>The beach was named and discovered in 1879 by Staff Commander EP Bedwell. 'Whitehaven' specifically originates from the English town of the same name, it was one of the many names, from the then English county of Cumberland, which Bedwell brought to the area. It followed James Cook's 1770 naming of the island group, the Cumberland Islands.</p>

                    <p>The reef here is part of the Ningaloo Coast, a world heritage area on the west coast of Australia. The Ningaloo Reef is the worldâ€™s largest fringing reef and the only reef of its size near any landmass. This makes the Ningaloo reef one of the most accessible large coral reef systems in the world, easily rivaling the Great Barrier for diversity while making seeing it as easy as wading into the shallow water.</p>
